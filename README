lvautoresize - automatically resize LVM volumes

This is simple perl script to resize LV when it's starting to get full. For this to work automatically, add
* * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/lvautoresize.pl 
to /etc/cron.d/lvaturesize and set your LVs in /etc/lvautoresize.conf (example config provided in contrib/lvautoresize.conf)
So far it only supports reiserfs (coz i dont use other fs and im lazy to implement others) but that will change ;] and if u really need something else it's only 1 line to edit in sources :)
